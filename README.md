# AWS-Deepracer
Got hands on with machine learning through a cloud-based 3D racing simulator, fully autonomous 1/18th scale race car driven by reinforcement learning, and global racing league.

In pole position to learn reinforcement learning

AWS DeepRacer gives you an interesting and fun way to get started with reinforcement learning (RL). RL is an advanced machine learning (ML) technique that takes a very different approach to training models than other machine learning methods. Its super power is that it learns very complex behaviors without requiring any labeled training data, and can make short term decisions while optimizing for a longer term goal.

-- Simulator: Build models in Amazon SageMaker and train, test, and iterate quickly and easily on the track in the AWS DeepRacer 3D racing simulator.

-- Car: Experience the thrill of the race in the real-world when you deploy your reinforcement learning model onto AWS DeepRacer.

-- League: Compete in the worldâ€™s first global, autonomous racing league, to race for prizes and glory and a chance to advance to the Championship Cup.
